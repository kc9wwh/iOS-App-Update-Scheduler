## Welcome to the iOS Applicaiton Update Scheduler for Jamf|PRO

This is a java application that uses the Jamf PRO Classic API to divide up iOS application updates to help prevent the server going down during this time.
Requirements:

 1. Java [Java MacOS Download] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
 2. Global App updates turned off in Jamf Pro and turned on for all the apps we want to have auto-updates turned on for. 
 
You simply download the .pkg and run the installer. It will get installed to the Applicaitons folder and can be run from there.

[MacOS Download](App-Update-Scheduler.pkg)

Happy Scheduling!
